# fire_risk_metric

## Introduction

This script uses SMART-DS data and GIS data from various sources to quantify the fire risk from the distribution and transmission power systems in a region.
These risk metrics are intended to be used 

## Input data and dependencies

This script was created and runs in python 3.

SMART-DS data and models are used for the power system model inputs. More information on this dataset can be found here: https://www.nrel.gov/grid/smart-ds.html

The GIS data related to aspects like ground cover and lightning strikes were sourced from a few different databases listed here:

## Running the risk quantification

## Visualizing the risk quantification

All input and output data include GIS coordinates and therefore can be mapped as different GIS layers.
